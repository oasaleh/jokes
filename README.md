This app was bootstrapped using [Remix](https://remix.run/) framework.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Using a Template

When you ran `npx create-remix@latest` there were a few choices for hosting. You can run that again to create a new project, then copy over relevant code/assets from your current app to the new project that's pre-configured for your target server.

Most importantly, this means everything in the `app/` directory, but if you've further customized your current application outside of there it may also include:

- Any assets you've added/updated in `public/`
- Any updated versions of root files such as `.eslintrc.js`, etc.

```sh
cd ..
